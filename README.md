**Status:** Full local demo implemented and tested — detection engine, FastAPI replay API with WebSocket alerts, React/HeroUI dashboard, nine threat scenarios, a local scikit-learn model layer, and benchmarked throughput/latency. Appwrite persistence and an optional Ollama explanation layer ship as adapters.

## What are we building?

It is a cybersecurity software system with a web dashboard. A local Python detection engine replays or ingests synthetic network-flow events, extracts behavioral features, detects threats, and emits explainable alerts. A React/TypeScript dashboard presents those alerts in near real time.

```text
Synthetic traffic → read-only replay → Python detection engine
                                      ↓
                              structured alerts
                                      ↓
                         Appwrite storage/realtime
                                      ↓
                           React security dashboard
```

The prototype simulates a secure monitoring enclave. It does not claim to implement a physical data diode.

## Dashboard

![Passive Detection Console — live dashboard](docs/screenshots/dashboard.png)

The live detection console shows scenario-driven replay controls, realtime metrics, a detection timeline, threat-class distribution, and a streaming alert table with severity, confidence, and supporting evidence for every detection.

## Features

**Threat classes detected (9):**

| Threat | Detection approach |
|---|---|
| SYN flood / volumetric DDoS | flow rate and source-IP entropy statistics |
| UDP reflection / amplification | packet rate + distinct sources toward amplification ports |
| Slowloris | held-open, incomplete connections; rate-capped to exclude floods |
| Botnet C2 beaconing | periodicity and inter-arrival analysis of repeating flows |
| DGA domains | entropy / n-gram analysis of DNS query names |
| DNS tunnelling | query length and record-type anomalies |
| Malware in encrypted sessions | TLS/QUIC metadata only — fingerprints, packet-size and timing |
| Reconnaissance / port scanning | fan-out across destination ports and hosts |
| Data exfiltration | asymmetric flow-volume and outbound/inbound byte ratios |

**Architectural guarantees:**

- Read-only ingest — never probes, re-contacts, blocks, or issues commands to the observed network.
- Metadata-only TLS/QUIC analysis — payloads are never decrypted.
- Streaming detection with bounded latency, not end-of-run batch reports.
- Standardized, explainable alerts: timestamp, flow ID, threat class, confidence, supporting evidence.
- Benchmark-verified throughput and latency (see [Testing](docs/TESTING.md)).

| Alert validation | Pydantic |
| Application backend | Appwrite |
| Frontend | React, TypeScript, Vite |
| UI components | HeroUI + Tailwind CSS |
| Charts | Recharts |
| Local explanation model | Optional Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct through Ollama |
| Deployment | Docker Compose |
| Testing | pytest, Vitest, React Testing Library |

## Demo principle

The primary detection path remains local and deterministic/measurable. The optional small local LLM only explains already-generated structured alerts; it does not make or change detection decisions.

## Run the local demo

### Option A: local processes

```bash
python -m pip install -e 'backend[test]'
uvicorn sih_detector.api:app --app-dir backend/src --reload
```

In a second terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`, select a scenario, and start replay. The dashboard uses the local API and WebSocket by default. No network capture, Appwrite credentials, or external AI API is required.

### Option B: Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up
```

The same dashboard is available at `http://localhost:5173`.
